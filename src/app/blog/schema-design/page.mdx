# Schema Design for Distributed SQL

## The Shard Key Dilemma

Choosing a shard key is the most critical decision.
* **Monotonically Increasing Keys (e.g., Timestamp):** Bad for inserts (hotspot on the last partition).
* **High Cardinality Keys (e.g., UUID):** Good for distribution, bad for range queries.

**Golden Rule:** Design for the query pattern, not just the data storage.
