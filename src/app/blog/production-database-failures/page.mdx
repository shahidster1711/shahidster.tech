# Production Database Failures

## Case Study: The Connection Storm

* **Scenario:** App servers restarted simultaneously.
* **Impact:** DB CPU spiked to 100% due to TLS handshakes.
* **Fix:** Implement connection pooling (PgBouncer) and randomized startup delays on app servers.

## Case Study: Transaction Wraparound

In PostgreSQL, failing to vacuum aggressive enough can lead to transaction ID wraparound, forcing the DB into read-only mode. **Monitoring `age(datfrozenxid)` is mandatory.**
