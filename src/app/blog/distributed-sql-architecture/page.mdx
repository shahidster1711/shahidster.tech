# Distributed SQL Architecture

Distributed SQL databases attempt to combine the ACID compliance of RDBMS with the horizontal scaling of NoSQL. This architecture relies heavily on **Aggregator (Coordinator)** and **Leaf (Data)** nodes.

## The Query Lifecycle

1.  **Parsing:** The Aggregator receives the SQL query.
2.  **Planner:** It determines if the query is a "Reference" query (metadata only) or a "Distributed" query.
3.  **Shuffle/Broadcast:** If the query involves a JOIN between two tables sharded on different keys, the system must move data across the network (Shuffle) or send the smaller table to all nodes (Broadcast).

**Key Takeaway:** Minimizing network movement during JOINs is the #1 way to optimize distributed SQL.
