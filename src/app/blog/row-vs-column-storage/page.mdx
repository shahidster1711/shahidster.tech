# Row vs Column Storage

Hybrid databases often support both.

* **Rowstore:** Optimized for point lookups (`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1`) and transactional writes. Data is stored sequentially on disk.
* **Columnstore:** Optimized for aggregations (`SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees`). Data is compressed by column type.

## The Segment Elimination Benefit

Columnstores excel because they use metadata (min/max values) to skip entire segments of data during scans. This is crucial for **Real-Time Analytics**.
