# Real-Time Analytics Trade-offs

Real-time usually means "freshness within seconds."

## The Ingestion Bottleneck

Transactional consistency (ACID) on ingestion slows down throughput.
* **Trade-off:** Use "READ COMMITTED" or looser isolation levels for analytical queries to prevent readers from blocking writers.
* **Micro-batching:** Instead of row-by-row inserts, buffer data and insert in batches to reduce transaction overhead.
