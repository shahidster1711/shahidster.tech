# System Design Lessons

At petabyte scale, small inefficiencies become expensive bills.

1.  **Observability:** If you can't measure it, you can't optimize it. Metrics must include P95 and P99 latency, not just averages.
2.  **Lifecycle Policies:** Data has gravity. Move cold data to cheaper storage (S3) aggressively using Tiered Storage features.
3.  **Capacity Planning:** Auto-scaling databases is slower than you think. Pre-scale for known events.
