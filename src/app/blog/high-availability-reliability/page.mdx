# High Availability Patterns

HA is expensive. You are paying for redundancy you hope to never use.

## Multi-AZ Deployments

In AWS, splitting nodes across Availability Zones (AZs) protects against data center failure but increases write latency due to synchronous replication.
* **Tip:** Keep app servers in the same AZ as the primary DB writer to minimize latency, but ensure the standby is in a different AZ.
